# PixelOracle

## PixelOracle is an all-in-one site that allows users to add their favorite games to an array via RAWGDB, and get some recommendations based on those games.

## Description

"PixelOracle uses a local PostgreSQL Database to save users game selections as delivered by the RAWG API. Then, the user can pass those games on to Google's Gemini LLR to receieve a list of recommended games, which they can then search and add."



- The Problem we hope to solve: Gamers never know which games to play so they play the same games every day. This project seeks to solve that.

- The way we hope to solve it: By analyzing the user's favorite games, Gemini can suggest games that appeal to the specific themes of those games.

- Solving this problem was difficult for the following reasons: Nothing but difficulty, really. PixelOracle uses data that delivers entirely differently than how it is needed, so much of our code functions to convert that data into types that are useable by other APIs.

- We learned the following: React Routing is a constant confusion, but I'm sure we all feel much more knowledgable with it now than when we started.
